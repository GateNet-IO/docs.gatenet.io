# Security
The security of GATENet&#39;s systems and platforms is our highest priority. Our developers, alongside third-party auditors and consultants, invest considerable effort to ensure platforms we deliver are safe and secure. Where possible, contract and application code is publicly verifiable, and we encourage security researchers to review the code as it has been published.
### Disclosure
If however a bug or vulnerability is discovered, we would encourage responsible disclosure to us so that it can be remedied.

Submit all bug/vulnerability disclosures to security@gatenet.io. The disclosure should include clear and concise steps to reproduce the discovered vulnerability in either written or video format. GATENet will follow up promptly with acknowledgment of the disclosure.
