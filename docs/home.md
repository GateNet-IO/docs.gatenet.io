Welcome to the GATENet documentation site.

## What is GATENet?

GATENet addresses the legacy issues inherent in the current Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) delivering a multi-chain network of protocols that will enhance the global clearing and settlement of securities through a new Digital FMI. We create efficiencies that remove the barriers to entry for those seeking to raise capital, reduce the trade life cycle costs, eliminating counterparty risk whilst building new interoperability for exchanges, institutions and investors across the world.

We work with key partners in multiple jurisdictions to collectively establish a network of digital securities exchanges, powered by GATENet, to produce a frictionless market place and inclusive financial system. Our aim is to expedite the growth of significant new markets that blockchain unlocks such as private markets, fixed income, real estate and ESG.
