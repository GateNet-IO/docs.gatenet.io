# Authorising GATE Tokens
In order to allow a wallet to interact with the smart contract, GATE tokens need to be authorised or &quot;unlocked&quot; in the connected wallet. To do so, click on the &quot;Manage Stake&quot; button:

If GATE tokens are not yet authorised or &quot;unlocked&quot;, the popup window will display the text &quot;Unlock GATE in order to stake&quot;:

To proceed, check the checkbox and the previously disabled &quot;Unlock GATE&quot; button will enable. Click on the &quot;Unlock GATE&quot; button:

Once the &quot;Unlock GATE&quot; button is clicked, your connected wallet should open a popup window where the approval transaction can be reviewed and confirmed.

Once confirmed there will be a wait while the transaction completes on the blockchain. When the transaction is successful there will be a confirmation screen displayed.

At this point, the wallet has authorised GATE tokens for use with the smart contract. The popup windows can be closed.
