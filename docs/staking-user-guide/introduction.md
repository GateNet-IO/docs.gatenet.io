# Introduction

The GATE Token Staking Platform is a non-custodial Staking Platform, built to operate on the Ethereum blockchain and provide Staking and Awards functionality to holders of GATENet&#39;s ERC-20 GATE token. The Platform allows GATE token holders to participate in Staking and earn Awards on locked tokens, without the need for GATENet to hold a user&#39;s GATE tokens.

The smart contract that is used for staking, by design, has a minimum lock-in period, whereby tokens that are staked can&#39;t be withdrawn until that minimum period has expired. This is a function of the smart contract which cannot be bypassed.

The source code used for the Staking Platform and smart contracts is publicly available on GATENet&#39;s GitHub account:

The GATE Token Staking Platform URL: [https://staking.gatenet.io](https://staking.gatenet.io)

In order to use the Platform, the GATE token holder needs to connect a compatible ERC-20 wallet to the Platform. The available options are as follows:

- **Metamask Wallet**
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **Wallet Connect compatible wallets**

For instructions on how to set up these wallets, further information can be found on the official websites of the appropriate wallet providers. GATENet does not provide these instructions:

- [https://walletconnect.org/](https://walletconnect.org/)

GATE tokens held in a compatible wallet above are able to be staked with the contract. It is imperative that the wallet holding GATE tokens have some ETH to cover transaction charges (gas).

The GATENet Staking platform runs on the Ethereum Mainnet network:
