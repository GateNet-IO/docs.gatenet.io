# Unstaking GATE Tokens
In order to unstake GATE tokens and claim any rewards earned, click on the &quot;Manage Stake&quot; button in the Portfolio section.

In the popup window that opens, click on the &quot;Unstake&quot; button at the top. Information will be presented showing the status of locked stake, available stake and available rewards. Where there are tokens that are unlocked *(Available Stake)* and rewards *(Available rewards)* to **withdraw**, the **‘Unstake Available Tokens & Claim Rewards’** button will withdraw these tokens to user's wallet.

:::note

Only tokens that have been staked for longer than the 30 day minimum period can be unstaked. The option to Unstake Available Tokens & Claim Rewards will be **disabled** if all tokens are still locked.

When the **Unstake Available Tokens & Claim Rewards** button is clicked, the connected wallet will open a popup window where the transaction can be reviewed and confirmed:

After confirming the transaction in the connected wallet, there will be a wait while the transaction is completed on the blockchain. When the transaction is successful there will be a confirmation screen displayed.

At this point the staked GATE tokens have been returned to the connected wallet from the smart contract and the popup windows can be closed.
