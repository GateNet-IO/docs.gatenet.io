# Unstaking GATE Tokens
In order to unstake GATE tokens and claim any rewards earned, click on the &quot;Manage Stake&quot; button in the Portfolio section.

In the popup window that opens, click on the &quot;Unstake&quot; button at the top. Information will be presented showing the status of locked and unlocked tokens. Where there are tokens that are unlocked and available to withdraw, there will be an option to &quot;Unstake&quot; or withdraw those tokens.
:::note

Only tokens that have been staked for longer than the 30 day minimum period can be unstaked. The option to unstake tokens will be hidden if all tokens are still locked.

When the unstake button is clicked, the connected wallet will open a popup window where the transaction can be reviewed and confirmed:

After confirming the transaction in the connected wallet, there will be a wait while the transaction is completed on the blockchain. When the transaction is successful there will be a confirmation screen displayed.

At this point the staked GATE tokens have been returned to the connected wallet from the smart contract and the popup windows can be closed.
