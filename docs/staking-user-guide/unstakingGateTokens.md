# Unstaking GATE Tokens
In order to unstake GATE tokens, click on the &quot;Manage Stake&quot; button in the Portfolio section.

In the popup window that opens, click on the &quot;Unstake&quot; button at the top. Options will be presented where either individual stake transactions can be unstaked, or an option to unstake all GATE tokens at once.
:::note

Only tokens that have been staked for longer than the 30 day minimum period can be unstaked. The option to unstake tokens will be disabled for tokens that have been staked for less than 30 days.

Once the desired option is clicked, the connected wallet will open a popup window where the transaction can be reviewed and confirmed:

After confirming the transaction in the connected wallet, there will be a wait while the transaction is completed on the blockchain. When the transaction is successful there will be a confirmation screen displayed.

At this point the staked GATE tokens have been returned to the connected wallet from the smart contract and the popup windows can be closed.
