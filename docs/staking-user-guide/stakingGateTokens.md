# Staking GATE Tokens
In order to stake GATE tokens once the wallet has been connected and GATE tokens have been authorised or "unlocked", click the &quot;Manage Stake&quot; button in the Portfolio section:

A popup window will appear where the amount of GATE tokens to be staked can be entered. The checkbox needs to be checked before the &quot;Stake&quot; button becomes available to be clicked.

After clicking the &quot;Stake&quot; button, the connected wallet application should open up another popup window where the transaction needs to be reviewed and confirmed:

After confirming the transaction in the connected wallet, there will be a wait while the transaction is completed on the blockchain. When the transaction is successful there will be a confirmation screen displayed.

At this point the GATE tokens are staked with the smart contract and all popup windows can be closed. The amount of staked GATE tokens will be displayed in the Portfolio section of the Platform.
