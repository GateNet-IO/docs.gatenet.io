# Connecting A Wallet
The first step to connect your wallet to the Staking Platform , is to click the &quot;Connect to Wallet&quot; button:

When the &quot;Connect to Wallet&quot; button is clicked, a popup window will appear which allows you to select which wallet type you would like to connect to the platform:

Once an option is selected follow the on-screen instructions requested by that wallet software. This generally involves authorising the wallet to be connected to the Staking Platform .

Please note - connecting the wallet does not mean the tokens are staked yet.

As an example, the Metamask browser extension has the following popups:

### Unlock the wallet

### Connect the Wallet

Once the wallet connection is authorised and successful, an abbreviated address of the connected wallet, should display in the top right hand corner of the page:

Next you can scroll down to the &quot;Portfolio&quot; section of the page, and see information related to the wallet address that has been linked to the Staking Platform:

Before a wallet is connected, the &quot;Portfolio&quot; section does not display any information:

There are no gas fees required to connect your wallet to the Staking Platform.
