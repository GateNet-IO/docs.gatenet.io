# Connecting A Wallet
The first step to connect your wallet to the platform, is to click the &quot;Connect to Wallet&quot; button:

When the &quot;Connect to Wallet&quot; button is clicked, a popup window will appear which allows you to select which wallet type you would like to connect to the platform:

Once an option is selected follow the on-screen instructions requested by that wallet software. This generally involves authorising the wallet to be connected to the platform. Please note - connecting the wallet does not mean the tokens are staked yet.

As an example, the Metamask browser extension has the following popups:

## Unlock the wallet

## Connect the wallet

Once the wallet connection is authorised and successful, an abbreviated wallet address (your wallet address), should display in the top right hand corner of the page:

Next you can scroll down to the &quot;Portfolio&quot; section of the page, and see information related to the wallet address that has been linked to the platform:

Before a wallet is connected, the &quot;Portfolio&quot; section does not display any information:

There are no gas fees required to connect your wallet to the platform.
