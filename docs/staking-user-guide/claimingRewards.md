When the &quot;Claim all Rewards&quot; button is clicked, the connected wallet application will open up a popup window where the transaction can be reviewed and confirmed:

After confirming the transaction in the connected wallet, there will be a wait while the transaction is completed on the blockchain. When the transaction is successful there will be a confirmation screen displayed.

At this point all GATE token rewards have been sent to the connected wallet from the smart contract and the popup windows can be closed.
